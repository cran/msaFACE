Description: The new methodology "moving subset analysis" provides functions to investigate the effect of environmental conditions on the CO2 fertilization effect within longterm free air carbon enrichment (FACE)  experiments. In general, the functionality is applicable to derive the influence of a third variable (forcing experiment-support variable) on the relation between a dependent and an independent variable.
